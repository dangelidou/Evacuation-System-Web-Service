# Evacuation System Web Service

An Intelligent Building Evacuation System that utilizes the Dijkstra algorithm in order to suggest the shortest paths to the available exits and shelters of a given building, based on the evacuees' speed and the current conditions of each room and hallway.
This project constitutes the main result of my bachelor thesis on intelligent evacuation systems. 

## Execution Instructions
The web service is temporarily hosted [here](http://155.207.201.131:8080/dijkstra.html).

If you wish to run it at your machine, you just have to dowload the executable file [evacuation_system.jar](https://github.com/dangelidou/Evacuation-System-Web-Service/blob/main/evacuation_system.jar). Make sure you have JRE or JDK installed.
Then you can run the service by running in the cmd/bash/PowerShell the command:
```
java -jar path/to/evacuation_system.jar
```
The project will then be available at the web address: 
```
http://localhost:8080/dijkstra.html
```
